## About

This program takes a file of geometric data and calculates properties for each shape such as centroid, area, and perimeter.

## Images

Included is a directory of images of ellipses, triangles, and squares. These images show a drawing of each of these shapes and their vertices
given their center points, orientation, and other data based on the shape.

**Note:** Images are drawn with the origin being at the top left and the y-axis increasing 
downward.
